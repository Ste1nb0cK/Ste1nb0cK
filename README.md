## About Me
I'm a physicist Linux/FOSS enthusiast. My main scientific interest is /Quantum Inofmration Theory/, both its applications to Quantum Technologies (such as high precision sensing) and mathematical/theoretical aspects.

## Projects

My projects are mainly about physics, here are a few I really enjoyed working on:

- [Site Percolation](https://github.com/Ste1nb0cK/2D_Percolation)
- [Metropolis Hastings for the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator ](https://github.com/Ste1nb0cK/QHO-MetropolisHastings)
- [Quantum Cellular Automata](https://github.com/Ste1nb0cK/QuantumCellularAutomata)

## Languages 
- 🐍 Python
- 🚗 Julia
- 🗲 C/C++
